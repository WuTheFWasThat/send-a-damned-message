# Send A Damn Message (python version)

This version (was historically first but) is now unmaintained, with many levels implementations out of date.

## Usage

To test a level, add a level file to `py/levels/$level_name.py`:

```
python send_a_damned_message.py $level_name
```

## level ideas:

Simplify meme to just be removing double letters, name "hmm"

Level where spaces are out of place
4 1 6 7
xxxx x xxx  xxxxxxxxxx
xxxx x  xxxxxx xxxxxxx
xxxx  xx xxxxx xxxxxxx
