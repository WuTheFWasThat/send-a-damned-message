# Development

WARNING: In general, looking at the source can spoil gameplay, so it may be good to play through the game first!

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm run server
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.re` file in `src` to see the page auto-reload.

## Bundle for Production

```sh
npm run buildprod
open build/index.html
```

## Python version

The original version of the game was written in Python, so I kept that version around in the directory [./py](`py/`).
It can sometimes be useful for quick development.

## Contributions

New level ideas and UI improvements both welcome!

# History

I was originally thinking to have a two player game, in which the two players can't communicate except through a chat room.  But the chat room is a noisy channel f and you see f(x) for incoming messages.
