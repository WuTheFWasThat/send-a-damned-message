# Send A Damn Message

To play:
```
python send_a_damned_message.py
```

You can type `SKIP` or `BACK` at any time to browse through levels.

Don't look at the source, it can spoil gameplay.

# Development

For now just read the code, there are no dependencies really.

WIP: porting to Reason-React at `send-a-damn-message`

# Game ideas
