# ReasonReact Template & Examples

- Extra helper documentation for ReasonReact (full ReasonReact docs [here](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)).

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run server
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.re` file in `src` to see the page auto-reload.

# Bundle for Production

We've also provided a barebone `indexProduction.html`, to serve your bundle.

```sh
npm run buildprod
open indexProduction.html
```
